**For Non-Technical Readers:**
This file contains functions that help keep web applications safe and user-friendly. It includes tools to prevent security issues by making user-generated content safe to display, to show log messages in a readable format, to synchronize settings across a form, and to display live updates and logs. These features enhance the overall user experience by providing a secure, interactive, and informative interface.

PRIMARY TECHNICAL RESPONSIBILITY FROM A USER PERSPECTIVE:
The file is primarily responsible for enhancing user interaction and safety within a web application. It achieves this through four key functions: making user-generated content safe to display, displaying log messages, synchronizing form settings, and providing live log updates.

KEY USER-FACING COMPONENTS AND USAGE:
- **`escapeHtml(unsafe)`**: This function takes user-generated content or any text that might contain special HTML characters and converts it into a safe format for display on a web page, preventing potential security vulnerabilities like cross-site scripting (XSS).
- **`displayLogs(logsArray, targetElement)`**: Displays an array of log messages within a specified HTML element on a webpage, providing users with feedback about the execution of a program or process. It ensures the log messages are displayed safely and are formatted for readability.
- **`attachLlmMode(event)`**: Synchronizes a selected mode across multiple input fields within a form when a specific event occurs, such as form submission or a change event. This simplifies user interaction by ensuring consistency across related fields.
- **`setupLogStream()`**: Establishes a live log stream connection, displaying system logs and status updates in real-time on a webpage. This allows users to monitor the application's status and troubleshoot issues without needing to refresh the page.

These components work together to create a more secure, interactive, and user-friendly web application.
